This game would predict the stock price of a particular 
 This can be played as a predicting game for all to refresh their minds.
We have developed this game in python using the inbuilt features of python and adding the optional options as 
a random value and for the correct answer a function for calculation is made.
The idea of gamification of stocks came from the opinion trading platform named “PROBO“ where we have to 
predict what is going to happen in future of a particular event .We have two options there “yes and no” the one 
which is most likely to happen will have less money and vice versa. In this game we have tried to implement this 
idea but in a way the there are the value of stocks as the options. There are four options if the user predicts the 
right option he/she wins the given bitcoin amount.

We have developed a solution to this problem . The solution will take a particular formula for prediction 
of stocks. Here we have used the exact formula from the google and have added in this program. Which 
is in Python Language. 
Here is a twist to that the prediction algorithm . We have developed a quiz game based on this in which 
the player shall predict his price and choose the closest proximity amount as the answer. If his/her 
prediction is correct then he/she will be awarded some bitcoins.
We have added this programming file to a website from which the players can access to this prediction 
game and win the virtual bit coins.
